Campy is a gift to all who care to make use of it. Whatever the use, use it. Jenna Fox, the creator, promises to never expect any compensation or credit. Campy does however depend on a few libraries (included in this distribution) which are not authored by Jenna, these include mootools, and the SHA256 function used by the campy cookie sessions functionality. These libraries are of course, licensed however they are by their original creators. The SHA256 library in particular lacks an explicit license, though it is assumed that the intent is public domain, and if there is any issue, it can be replaced with another hashing algorithm.
